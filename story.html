				<h1>Chang'e here is a very famous Chinese myth about this woman who is said to live on the moon.</h1>
				<p>There are different variations of the myth but the basic story is that she and her husband were once immortal beings who were made mortal because of their bad behavior. They then attempted to achieve immortality again through the use of a pill but Chang'e got greedy and took too much of the pill and ended up floating up to the moon where she remained stuck over time. She is the subject of much Chinese poetry and is one of the central reasons for celebration each Autumn during the Chiense Moon Festival.</p>
<h1>Moon Rabbit. This is an interesting myth because it crosses across several different cultures.</h1>
				<p>The moon rabbit or jade rabbit is said to be one of the companions that Chang'e eventually was allowed to have with her one the moon. However, it is also a symbol that shows up in myths about the moon in Korea and in Japan.</p>

				<h1>astronaut Harrison Schmitt standing next to a boulder at Taurus-Littrow during the third EVA</h1>
				<p>The Cold War-inspired "space race" and "Moon race" between the Soviet Union and the United States of America accelerated with a focus on the Moon. This included many scientifically important firsts, such as the first photographs of the then-unseen far side of the Moon in 1959 by the Soviet Union, and culminated with the landing of the first humans on the Moon in 1969, widely seen around the world as one of the pivotal events of the 20th century, and indeed of human history in general.</p>
